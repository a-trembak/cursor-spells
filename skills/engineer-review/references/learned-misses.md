# Learned misses (kit seed)

Curated miss classes that every engineer-review load. Consumer projects may add more in `.cursor/review-learnings.md` (see [review-learn-protocol.md](review-learn-protocol.md)). Prefer linking gates over restating them.

### `miss_side-effect-live-actor`

```yaml
id: miss_side-effect-live-actor
miss_class: side-effect × live actor
triggers:
  - resetApiState | cache invalidate | sync vs defer
  - remount / key= | overlay open/close | isLoading→disabled
  - stateful input inside host that re-filters children each keystroke
phases: [logic, architecture, security]
gate: R1
also: [R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7]
rule_one_liner: >-
  When the diff changes when something runs, replay still-mounted
  subscriptions and host widgets before closing; writers≠probes;
  competing-actor tests required.
anti_pattern: >-
  Review only the changed writer/filter and skip live shells or nested
  inputs that react to the side-effect.

Mechanism: a timing or list-re-render side-effect interacts with actors that stay mounted (RTK subscribers writing shared auth; Menu/Popover autofocus remounting search). Diff-only review misses both.

Required check: [interaction-replay-checklist.md](interaction-replay-checklist.md) R1–R7. Auth shape: [auth-rtk-checklist.md](auth-rtk-checklist.md).

Test shape: competing actor (active subscription **or** open menu with focused search) across the side-effect — not isolated unwrap/matcher-only tests.
