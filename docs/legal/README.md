# Legal documents — the kit (working title)

Formal English policy documents for this pipeline kit authored by **Andrey Trembak** (`a-trembak`).

The git remote may still be named `cursor-spells` until a human renames it. **Product title options (do not use third-party marks such as “Cursor” in the name):** [NAME-OPTIONS.md](NAME-OPTIONS.md).

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) | Privacy Policy — data use for a local agent kit; honest limits of author control |
| [TERMS.md](TERMS.md) | Terms of use / rights notice — MIT consistency, reserved names, acceptable use |
| [DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md) | Disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability (AS IS / use at own risk) |
| [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md) | Trademark / rights protection mark — displayable “Rights reserved” block |
| [NAME-OPTIONS.md](NAME-OPTIONS.md) | Creative product rename candidates (no third-party marks); manual GitHub rename |
| [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md) | Research sources (including Context7 libraries/topics consulted) |

## Install agreement

`csp install` / `csp update` require agreement to Privacy, Terms, Disclaimer, and NOTICE before continuing. Non-interactive runs need `--agree-policy` or `--i-agree` (or `CSP_AGREE_POLICY=1`). A successful agreement writes `.cursor/csp-policy-accepted` (or `~/.cursor/csp-policy-accepted` for `--user-only`) with `accepted_at`, `agree_via`, `policy_hash`, `policy_docs`, and `kit_commit`.

## Quick points

- **Software copyright:** MIT as stated in the root `README.md` (Software Package Data Exchange: `MIT`). No root `LICENSE` file was present when these docs were written — see TERMS for the consistency note.  
- **Names / identity:** reserved; MIT does not grant trademark or endorsement rights.  
- **Warranty:** none; pipeline use can cause bugs and regressions; see DISCLAIMER.  
- **Russian language:** forbidden inside this pipeline under the kit’s sanctions-based language policy; use tools outside the pipeline if needed. Runtime enforcement is documented in [`docs/superpowers/pipeline-language.md`](../superpowers/pipeline-language.md).
